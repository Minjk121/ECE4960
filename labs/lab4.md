# Lab 4: Characterize your car

The goal of the lab is to understand the characteristics and capabilities of the robot before adding motor drive driver for the future labs. 
Before this lab, the Artemis board, IMU and TOF sensors were soldered and connected.

Force 1 Cyclone Remote Control Car was used with 600mAh and 850mAh battery packs. 

### Category A: Simple Measurements

Simple measurements were collected without any control of the car. Its length, width and wheel diameter are measured as shown in the manual below.

|  Length (cm)  |   Width (cm)  |  Height (cm)  |   Weight (g)  | Wheel Diameter (cm) | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | 
|     17.9      |     14.2      |      7.9      |     49.9      |         7.9         | 

|  Battery Time (850mAh) |   Average Rotational speed  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
|     7 min 52.9 sec     |         4.0 rev/sec         |

### Category B: Experimental Setups

Using 600mAh, braking distance and decceletaion were measured on the tile in Phillips Hall.

|   Tests on Tile    | Braking Distance (ft) | Braking Time (s) | Deceleration (ft/m^2) |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------- |---------------------- |
| Average Measurement|          4.667        |      1.21        |          6.375        |

The tests were conducted with different conditions such as 850 mAh battery and carpet; however, the braking distance could not be measured because the car was flipped instead of braking due to the change in battery and higher resistance on the surface. 

The 850mAh battery was used for the rest of the tests.

|         Tests       | Max Speed on Tile(ft/s) | Max Speed on Carpet (ft/s) | 
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Average Measurement |           11.96         |             11.76          |
