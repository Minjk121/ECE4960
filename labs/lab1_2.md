# Lab 5: Motor driver and open loop control

The goal of the lab is to implement two dual motor drivers with the Artemis board and change from manual to open loop control. The car is designed to acheive a speed as a "fast robot" and controlled by pre-progammed series of moves. 

## Prelab
Before the lab, I configured the bluetooth fucntion (lab 2) for the communication between the computer and Artemis board. The lab computer was used instead of my own laptop because the arduino error with Windows 11 OS. After setting up the bluetooth, the address of my Artemis board has been found to be:

Advertising BLE with MAC: c0:07:c1:8d:38:44
